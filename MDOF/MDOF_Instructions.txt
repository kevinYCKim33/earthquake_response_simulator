******MDOF Instructions*******
1. Open up Script titled "User_Input_MDOF.m" 

2. Enter structural properties and initial conditions at every node, Select
analysis method type, time increment

3. Identify if feeding ground motion (1) or theoretical forcing function (2) under Ground_Motion variable.

4. Save "User_Input_MDOF.m"

5. Open up Script titled "MDOF_ForcingFunction.m"

6. Several Sample scripts are provided. 
	Sample #1: Free Vibration Case
